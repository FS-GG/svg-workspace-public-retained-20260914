# SvgWorkspacePublicRetained

A server-authoritative multiplayer SVG game workspace: one F# ASP.NET Core server,
one Fable/Elmish browser client, and a package-backed SVG player sharing a
product-owned `Domain` and an explicit, versioned wire protocol.

## The transport boundary (ADR-0073)

- **Plain ASP.NET Core HTTP endpoints** (`Server/Program.fs`'s `/api/bootstrap`) own
  typed request/response operations. Every operation is an explicit, versioned DTO
  pair in `Protocol/Http.fs`, encoded and decoded by named codec functions on both
  the .NET side (`Thoth.Json.Net`) and the Fable side (`Thoth.Json`) -- never
  reflection-driven serialization, never a generated RPC proxy.
- **ASP.NET Core SignalR** (`Server/GameHub.fs`, `Client/SignalR.fs`) owns
  connection-oriented traffic: input, snapshots, presence, and resync, through a
  narrow, hand-written binding over the official `@microsoft/signalr` npm client.
- `Protocol/Http.fs` and `Protocol/Realtime.fs` are compiled *twice* from the same
  source: once by `Protocol/Protocol.fsproj` (against `Thoth.Json.Net`, for the
  server) and once as a direct `Compile Include` from `Client/Client.fsproj`
  (against `Thoth.Json`, via `dotnet fable`). `#if FABLE_COMPILER` guards only the
  `open` statement; every codec call is the same named function on both sides.
  `Protocol.Tests/cross-runtime/` proves this pairing for real: it builds both
  targets and round-trips every DTO .NET-encode/Fable-decode and the reverse,
  including two deliberately rejected cases.

Fable.Remoting is not used (superseded by ADR-0073; see
`docs/reports/2026-08-01-fable-full-stack-toolchain-compatibility-spike.md` and
`FS.GG.Templates#370` for why).

## The sample

`Domain/ArenaContent.fs` and `Domain/ArenaRules.fs` define the pure authoritative
arena shared by the .NET server and the Fable Studio. Players occupy cells on a fixed
grid, and `Pathfinding.astar` -- the `LockstepExact` surface of the
published `FS.GG.Game.Core` Fable compatibility profile
(`fs-gg-game-core-fable-lockstep-v1`) -- resolves movement. Both `Domain` (server)
and `Client/Movement.fs` (browser, local path preview only) call the *same*
published package function. The shared arena transition uses Game.Core kinematics
for solid geometry, interaction proximity, moving-hazard contact, health, score,
win, and restart. The server's `Server/RoomAuthority.fs` is the only place a networked
move is committed. `Server/RoomAuthority.fs` also enforces the
stale-input guard (a non-increasing input sequence is dropped) and the
disconnect/reconnect contract: a reconnecting client always gets a bounded, full
authoritative resync, never a delta log.

The SVG player is the default product composition in Templates 0.14. Choose it explicitly
with `--bundle player`, or select `studio`, `tactical`, `arcade`, or `complete`. Studio adds
the integrated Create/Arrange/Play/Review tools; tactical and arcade add their editable
examples plus Studio; complete includes both. The player bundle contains no Studio or example
source. Rendering's profile remains independent from this product composition choice.

The compatibility flag remains readable for existing scripts: explicit
`--svgFoundation true` selects the retained preview-compatible complete composition, while
explicit `--svgFoundation false` retains the pre-0.14 non-SVG product. The old and new selectors
are mutually exclusive, including redundant combinations; using both is rejected during template
argument validation, before the destination is written. Bundle selection does not select or
activate a lifecycle.

The selected tool payload carries separate player and `SvgFoundation/Studio` entries. The composition binds
both to exact public producer versions and enables the product-owned command profiles.
Build them with `bash SvgFoundation/build.sh` and `bash SvgFoundation/Studio/build.sh`. The Studio
build copies its worker, verified font data, notices and npm lock from the restored producer package
into ignored output. The generated workspace exposes Create, Arrange, Play and Review modes, responsive
docks, palette/help/rebind flows, and keyboard, pointer, touch and gamepad routes over the same effective
profile. Templates `0.14.0` uses Rendering `0.31.0`, Game `0.16.0`, Net `0.6.0`, and Audio `0.6.0` as one
qualified public set.

The SVG runtime renders complete version 3 authority snapshots through monotonic retained
scene replacement. `W/A/S/D` submits movement to the required server, `E` interacts with nearby game
content, and `R` requests a restart after a terminal outcome. The server owns position, health, score,
collectible state, win state, moving-hazard time, and restart; every connected SVG player renders those snapshots. The
gesture-unlocked Audio host plays the shipped non-silent movement cue for accepted game actions. The
separately bundled Studio is never linked into the player output. Studio opens the same
`continuous-arena` document, compiles its typed gameplay elements into the same `ArenaContent` contract,
and runs the same pure `ArenaRules` transition in Play. Create, Arrange, Play, Review, browser persistence,
and reload retain one authored scene root, camera, selection, and history while runtime preview geometry
stays transient. **Export playable arena content** writes the validated content file consumed by the authority.

The realtime baseline has four deliberately small but production-relevant rules:

- Bootstrap issues an opaque session capability. The hub URL carries neither player
  identity nor capability; the client sends a versioned `sessionHello` only after the
  SignalR transport opens, and the server rejects unknown, duplicate-live, or
  incompatible bindings.
- A reconnect performs that hello again and receives one full authoritative snapshot.
  Explicit resync cursors are accepted only from zero through the current tick; a
  negative or future cursor is rejected instead of being treated as a valid frontier.
  Client transport callbacks only dispatch Elmish messages, making connecting,
  reconnecting, closed, and failed states explicit rather than retaining a hidden
  second UI state.
- Inputs are admitted at hub arrival but resolve at the next server tick frontier,
  sorted by player identity and sequence. Transport scheduling therefore cannot decide
  gameplay order; snapshots with an older tick cannot rewind the client view.
- Realtime DTO version 1 remains frozen for the retained legacy grid client. It uses a separate legacy
  authority path, so new walls, hazards, and terminal rules cannot silently change that client's gameplay.
  Version 2 retains its frozen cooperative arena format. Version 3 adds immutable authored boundary and spawn
  alongside complete gameplay state and exact content/schema identity. Missing fields,
  unknown actions, stale input, wrong snapshot compatibility, and content mismatches fail before gameplay
  changes. Replay digests use the same complete canonical state on .NET and Fable. Saved Studio scene
  envelopes retain the Rendering-owned schema identifier; the authority consumes only a separately exported,
  validated arena-content file.
- Admission is bounded to the arena's 240 cells, with no occupied-cell fallback. A
  bootstrap that would exceed that bound returns HTTP 429. Unbound and disconnected
  capabilities expire after two minutes; the tick loop cleans them up and releases
  their reserved authority.
- `stop`/disconnect removes a connection's group membership and room presence. The
  capability remains available for its bounded reconnect window, keeping the starter
  zero-config while making the resource boundary visible and testable.

## Running it

For local authority development, run `dotnet run --project Server/Server.fsproj`; the
browser client proxies `/api` and the `/hub` WebSocket upgrade to
`http://localhost:5000`. To run the authority with Studio-authored geometry, export
the content JSON and set `ArenaContentPath` to that file before starting the server;
invalid schema, identity, or geometry refuses startup. The root build writes the selected static SVG player to
`artifacts/static-player`, optional Studio to `artifacts/static-studio`, and the required
independently deployable ASP.NET Core authority to `artifacts/authority-server`. Deploy the
static artifact and authority together; a static host alone is not a complete multiplayer game.

`bash ./build.sh` runs the product qualification build: locked restore/build/test the `.NET` solution
(`Domain`, `Protocol`, `Server`, and their `.Tests` projects), the cross-runtime
V1/V2/V3 codec and replay proof, bounded authored-rule Quint simulation, the Fable/Vite client production build, and the
selected SVG player (plus Studio when present), authority publish, and Playwright
`Browser.Tests` two-context scenario. It writes TRX/JUnit evidence to
`artifacts/test-results/`; import those observed reports with
`fsgg-sdd evidence --from-test-report`. SDD remains the single lifecycle owner.
Set `QUINT_BIN` to the executable for Quint 0.32.0 before running the build. The
checked workflow downloads `quint-linux-amd64`, verifies SHA-256
`939b64095b706017f2f202c6f99c860c40be7c31bddc2b98557316e50f42cd7f`, and exports
that path only for the build; use the same recipe locally rather than an unpinned
global or npm executable.

## Lanes

`Domain`, `Domain.Tests`, `Protocol`, `Protocol.Tests` (plus its
`Protocol.Tests/cross-runtime/` cross-runtime codec proof), `Server`, `Server.Tests`,
`Client`, and `Browser.Tests`.

## Package locking

This workspace restores in **locked mode** (`RestoreLockedMode` in
`Directory.Build.props`), so every `packages.lock.json` beside a project is
enforced: a package whose content hash differs from the committed one fails the
restore rather than being silently substituted.

Locked mode is only meaningful if the lock can be regenerated, so here is the path.
After changing any `PackageReference`, regenerate and commit the affected locks:

```bash
dotnet restore SvgWorkspacePublicRetained.slnx --force-evaluate
dotnet restore Client/Client.fsproj --force-evaluate
dotnet restore SvgFoundation/SvgFoundation.fsproj --force-evaluate
dotnet restore SvgFoundation/Studio/Studio.fsproj --force-evaluate
dotnet restore Protocol.Tests/cross-runtime/CodecProbe.Net/CodecProbe.Net.fsproj --force-evaluate
dotnet restore Protocol.Tests/cross-runtime/CodecProbe.Fable/CodecProbe.Fable.fsproj --force-evaluate
```

`Client`, the selected SVG projects, and the two `cross-runtime` probes need their
own lines because they are not members of the solution. Never hand-edit a lock file; a hash typed by a human
is a hash no restore can reproduce.

Two settings keep those hashes reproducible, and both are load-bearing (see
`FS.GG.Templates#380`):

- **`NuGet.config` pins the source.** Its `<clear />` drops every source inherited
  from the machine, so a package is never served by whatever local feed the host
  happens to configure. To use a private or mirrored feed, add it there and then
  regenerate the locks with the commands above.
- **`DisableImplicitLibraryPacksFolder` in `Directory.Build.props`** stops the F#
  SDK appending its own bundled `library-packs` folder to the restore sources. That
  folder ships an `FSharp.Core` archive with the same version as nuget.org's but
  different bytes, so leaving it enabled lets one restore record one content hash
  and the next restore reject it with
  `NU1403: Package content hash validation failed`.
- **`RestorePackagesPath` in `Directory.Build.props`** gives this workspace its own
  `.nuget/packages` folder instead of the machine-wide one. Source pinning alone is
  not enough: NuGet's shared package folder is keyed by id and version only, so
  whichever build reached it first decides which of the two `FSharp.Core` archives
  lives there, and a later restore validates the committed hash against *that*
  entry. A private folder is what makes the committed hash enforceable on any
  machine rather than only on machines that happen to agree.

  Two consequences worth knowing. Packages are not shared with your other
  checkouts, so a cold build downloads its own copies. And `.nuget/` belongs in
  your ignore file — this workspace ships without one, in common with `bin/`,
  `obj/`, `artifacts/` and `node_modules/`.

`build.sh` refuses to restore at all if the lock files are missing, because a
locked-mode restore with no lock on disk does not fail — it quietly writes a new
lock from whatever the machine resolves, which defeats the entire mechanism.
