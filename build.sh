#
# `--locked-mode` with no lock file on disk does not fail: NuGet quietly AUTHORS one
# from whatever the ambient machine resolves, and every later restore then enforces
# that unreviewed lock. That is not a hypothetical — `dotnet new`'s default source
# exclude list contains `**/*.lock.json`, so for the whole of 0.8.0 every generated
# workspace arrived with zero lockfiles and silently invented its own. The symptom
# was `NU1403: Package content hash validation failed`, three steps downstream and
# nowhere near the cause.
#
# So assert presence BEFORE restoring. A missing lock here means the template stopped
# delivering it, and the correct outcome is a loud red at the boundary that owns the
# guarantee — not a restore that succeeds by inventing the thing it was meant to check.
