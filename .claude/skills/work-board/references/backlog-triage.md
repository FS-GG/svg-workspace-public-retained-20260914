# Workspace Backlog triage between reconciliation and dispatch

`Backlog` means parked, not irrelevant. Plain workspace `batch`/`take` scheduling intentionally reads
`Ready`, so the host must classify parked work before sizing a wave. Triage changes eligibility; the
typed scheduler still owns touch-set-disjoint selection inside this single repository.

## Runtime boundary and ordered planning

First run the coordination-wiring preconditions in [deep detail](deep-detail.md). Missing board env,
kit skills, shim, auth, or readable engine state stops non-zero with the documented retrofit or
`work-roadmap` guidance, without mutating the board. Never interpret missing wiring or a failed read as
an empty workspace.

For every board-capable wave, in this order:

1. Run workspace-scoped `check-board` and consume its complete four-part
   result: mechanical changes; queued or failed writes; judgement findings; and the fresh post-apply
   result. Flush queued writes and repeat the fresh pass. An unreadable part stops planning.
2. Read the current inventory with
   `scripts/fsgg-coord ready --repo <this-repo> --status Backlog --json`. Read each relevant issue and
   its comments; discard any inventory captured before the preceding worker wave.
3. Give every row exactly one classification below and explicitly select routine or strict for each
   actionable row under the base skill's policy boundary. Routine admissions enter the one-owner plan
   without a board write. Apply only evidence-supported strict-route board writes, then verify them with
   another fresh workspace read.
4. Only then size a maximal disjoint Ready wave for strict items with
   `scripts/fsgg-coord batch --repo <this-repo> -n <cap> --json`. Each isolated worker mints its own
   identity and runs bare `scripts/fsgg-coord take --repo <this-repo> --json`. Never hand-pick Backlog
   items or use `--include-backlog` to bypass triage.

## Strict-route feedback and audit content disposition

This section applies only when the plan contains strict items. A routine-only pass does not create a
planning receipt or content-disposition artifact; ordinary intake observations remain non-blocking.

Before declaring triage fresh, record every feedback or audit intake in the authoritative content-intake
inventory and record exactly one typed content-disposition for each entry.
The planning receipt rejects an unknown or stale disposition;
absence is not a default `not-reusable` decision. Each record names the source finding, decision maker,
current source SHA, observation time, and a receipt identity bound to all of those facts.

Use exactly one of `not-reusable`, `skill`, `example/fixture`, or `skill+example/fixture`. A reusable
record must name its durable consumer path: a skill/reference is under `.agents/skills/` or
`.claude/skills/`, and an example/fixture is executable or gate-owned (for example under `tests/`), not
a retrospective Markdown file under `docs/`. `not-reusable` has no consumer path and carries the
evidence-backed rationale plus a typed URL or `path:line` reference for that explicit judgement. For a failure boundary captured in an example or
fixture, include the negative/mutation case that proves the gate can fail.

## Exhaustive classifications

### Promote to Ready

An explicitly admitted routine item does not need promotion, `batch`, or `take`; its owner uses the
existing issue's native PR closing link and lets reconciliation project the merge asynchronously.

For strict work, promote with `scripts/fsgg-coord set-field <ref> Status Ready` only when live evidence says the issue is
open, implementable now, has a valid declared touch-set, has no unresolved implementation dependency,
has no active claim or PR, and requires no human choice. Re-read the row before counting it in a wave.

Promotion changes eligibility, not assignment. A strict item enters the normal single-repo `batch`/`take`
collision boundary, which remains responsible for selecting a touch-set-disjoint set. Every promoted
strict item still runs inside the existing pnext-item envelope: a current agent-authored delivery-route receipt
selects lightweight or SDD-required delivery, and the worker finalizes the schema-v2 development-feedback report
before its PR.

The **simple-versus-complex SDD lifecycle branch** is an explicit receipt-bound agent judgement, never a
host heuristic: the checklist supplies evidence, while the selected lightweight or SDD-required route
supplies the lifecycle obligations.

### Retain in Backlog

Retain only with a concrete reason already supported by the issue or its comments, such as an explicit
future milestone or deliberate parking decision. Record the ref and reason in the wave report. Do not
invent priority or rewrite vague prose merely to manufacture a reason. A row without an evidenced
reason is awaiting human judgement, not silently retained work.

**Never park a row to reorder a wave.** On 2026-07-27 a driver moved nineteen actionable hardening rows
into `Backlog` for no reason except to push five structural items to the front of the lane pack. It
worked, and it left nineteen rows whose only recorded reason lived in a session transcript — which is
exactly the untriaged state the paragraph above refuses. It also conflated two different facts the board
must keep apart: "not now" and "not until a human decides".

That workaround existed because the scheduler ignored `Phase` and ordered candidates by issue number, so
`Status` was the only priority lever there was. It no longer is. `batch` and `take` pack lanes
priority-greedily by a rank derived from blocking count, `Class`, `Phase` and age (`.github#1598`), and
the highest-ranked schedulable item is always admitted. To raise an item's priority, fix the input that
makes it important:

| you want | set this |
|---|---|
| this unblocks other work | the real `Blocked by` edges on the items waiting for it |
| this is broken now | `Class` = `defect` (via its `Class:` body line, then `reconcile --apply`) |
| this comes early in the plan | `Phase` |
| this has waited too long | nothing — a `Ready` row escalates above class and phase on its own |

`scripts/fsgg-coord batch --repo <this-repo> --explain` prints the ranking, every candidate's inputs, and
how many lanes each admitted item displaced. If an item is not where you expect, that output names the
input to fix. Two `batch` calls over a moving board may legitimately return different sets — rank moves
as the board moves — so size a wave from one read rather than diffing two.

### Set Blocked

Set `Blocked` only when a parseable issue reference names a live implementation dependency that must
land before this item can be authored. A park is **two writes, not one**: the `Status` column and the
`Blocked by` **board field** — the Projects v2 field, never a body line. `Blocked by:` written into the
issue body is inert: nothing that clears a blocker reads the body, so it looks like a declaration and
does nothing (`.github#1933`) — the exact shape that twice let a fully-resolved, already-superseded field
value survive a park because the real edge had gone into the body instead. Write both in one call:

```
scripts/fsgg-coord set-field --batch <ref> Status=Blocked "Blocked by=<dependency-ref>"
```

and verify the fresh row afterward — including that the field, not just the body, carries the ref.
Always write both fields yourself in the same call rather than depending on the engine to catch an
omission — this is belt-and-braces, not a substitute for writing the edge. The engine refuses an
incoherent `Blocked` write from `release --status Blocked`, the single-field
`set-field <ref> Status Blocked`, and `set-field --batch` (`.github#2079`, extended to the batch form by
`.github#2098`, merged) — but not from `add --status Blocked`, the filing-time write that boards a new
row already `Blocked`; that gap is real and tracked separately. The instruction to write both fields
predates all of these gates and stands regardless of what any of them catches: the brief that produced
`FS.GG.Templates#348` said to set the dependency field without naming it, and a gate closing does not
make that guidance unnecessary. Topical relationships, temporary path overlap, unreadable refs, and
guessed blocker meaning do not qualify.

### Await human judgement

Surface the row without guessing status when actionability depends on missing or ambiguous touch-sets,
blocker meaning, priority, epic discharge, scope, acceptance criteria, or another decision the evidence
does not answer. Carry the exact question and source evidence into the wave report. This preserves
`check-board`'s mechanical-versus-human authority boundary.

## Fresh follow-ups and termination

After owners finish, discard the old inventory. For routine items, verify only the exact-head required
checks, native PR merge/readback, and native issue-closing link; independent review, done stamp, claim
release, and schema-v2 feedback are not routine gates. For strict workers, verify their PR,
independent-review evidence and material-only filing, done stamp, claim release, pending writes, and
schema-v2 feedback. Run the complete workspace reconcile pass again and re-read Backlog
before sizing another wave. A follow-up filed by the preceding wave is classified immediately:
actionable work is promoted and becomes eligible for the next disjoint `batch`/`take`; parked or
ambiguous work is reported.

An empty Ready batch is not completion while any Backlog row is actionable or untriaged. When a fresh
pass leaves only deliberately parked rows with evidenced reasons or awaiting-human rows, report them and
allow the unattended run to stop. Do not spin on the same unchanged classification.

Triage the **class** alongside the status. A row whose text carries no `Class:` line is untriaged in the
sense that matters to the stopping rule in [host-loop](host-loop.md), and `lint` reports it as
`CLASS-UNSET`; a row classed `hardening` is triaged and deliberately retained, which is a different state
and must be reported as one. Class from evidence — the item's own text, a `[decision]` prefix, a
`Blocked on: human/decision` sentinel — and never from a guess about how bad it looks.
