# work-board

One command's worth of intent: **"take this workspace's own project board and burn it down, as
parallel as it is safe to be inside one tree — and don't make me drive."** The board is the plan and
the ledger both: the host reads it to find schedulable work, and each item's worker writes back to it
when the work lands and is done-stamped. Every item gets a **fresh subagent with fresh context**; when
its item is merged and stamped, that subagent **dies**, and the host re-plans against the board it just
changed. The loop ends when a fresh reconcile shows the board is genuinely done, and then the host
writes the report and lands it.

This skill fills the last cell of a 2×2 the org's loop family had left empty (ADR-0064) — **single
repo × board ledger**:

| | markdown ledger | board ledger |
|---|---|---|
| **single repo** | [work-roadmap](../../work-roadmap/SKILL.md) — `driver`, always materialized | **`work-board` — this file** |
| **cross-repo** | (n/a) | `drive-board` — `operator`, never materialized |

So it is the **board-ledger sibling of [work-roadmap](../../work-roadmap/SKILL.md)** (same parent-loop-of-
disposable-subagents shape, but the ledger is the wired board rather than a markdown file) and the
**single-repo sibling of `drive-board`** (same reconcile → size-wave → spawn →
verify-against-ground-truth → re-plan shape, but the fan-out is *one repo* instead of every repo).

It owns exactly one thing neither of its parts does: **the single-repo, board-driven scheduling loop**.
Everything else it delegates and does not re-teach:

- **Analysis** is `check-board`'s. The host does not hand-roll board truth — it
  runs the reconcile pass and reads its findings. That is also where **blockers that emerge mid-work**
  are caught: nothing re-checks a `Blocked by` when its blocker clears, so each planning pass re-runs it.
- **The worker** is `pnext-item`. Each subagent runs it start to done-stamp; the
  host never implements an item itself. Every item goes through a worker that claims with the lock,
  isolates in a worktree, opens a PR, and merges on green.
- **The claim/worktree/touch-set protocol** is
  `intra-repo-parallel-work`'s. Here it is **load-bearing in a way
  it is not for drive-board**: all of work-board's workers share **one working tree**, so the `Paths:`
  disjointness `take` already enforces is what keeps a wave from colliding. The host leans on it; it
  does not re-implement it.

## Where this runs, and the precondition that decides everything

A **coordination-wired scaffolded product workspace** — one that `new-sdd-workspace` (or `fsgg-sdd
scaffold`) built with coordination wiring ON (the default). That wiring, and nothing this skill ships,
is what makes the loop possible: it records the board identity as `FSGG_COORD_OWNER`/`FSGG_COORD_PROJECT`
env in `.claude/settings.json`, vendors the `scripts/fsgg-coord` shim + engine, and materializes
`check-board`, `pnext-item`, and `intra-repo-parallel-work`. work-board **composes what is already
there**; it needs no new tooling. Its absence — a workspace scaffolded `--no-coordination` — is exactly
the "fail gracefully" boundary below.

### The graceful-fail preconditions (ADR-0064 §4.1)

work-board is **always materialized** into a scaffold — the coordination kit is wired *after* the scaffold
materializer runs, so no scaffold-time predicate could see it (ADR-0063), which is why "fail gracefully"
is a **runtime** property, not a materialization gate. So before the loop, check these **in order** and
**stop cleanly on the first miss** — print one clear line that names the cause *and* the alternative, and
**exit non-zero without touching the board**. Never crash, and never degrade into a plain edit loop:

1. **The board is wired.** `FSGG_COORD_OWNER` and `FSGG_COORD_PROJECT` are set (read them from the
   environment / `.claude/settings.json`). Absent → *"this workspace has no coordination board (scaffolded
   `--no-coordination`?). Use [work-roadmap](../../work-roadmap/SKILL.md) for a markdown roadmap, or **retrofit**
   the coordination kit + board onto it with `new-sdd-workspace retrofit <workspace>` (add `--board
   owner/title` for a non-default board) — the idempotent inverse of the scaffold-time wiring, which is
   exactly what `--no-coordination` left off (#1343)."*
2. **The kit is present.** `scripts/fsgg-coord` resolves, and `check-board` + `pnext-item` are
   materialized in this tree. Absent → the same class of message: the workspace was not wired for
   coordination, so this is not the skill for it.
3. **The engine can read the board.** `fsgg-coord` can reach and read the board (auth + reachability).
   The default org board (`FS-GG` / `Coordination`) works on any engine; a workspace pointed at its
   **own** (non-`FS-GG`) board needs the post-0.4.0 engine for the offer/chore path (#1140) — a
   version/permission failure stops with the reset/permission guidance it prints, **not** a stack trace.
   That own board can be **user-owned**, not only org-owned (#1344, #1349): set `FSGG_COORD_OWNER_TYPE=user`
   with an explicit `FSGG_COORD_OWNER` for a named account, or `FSGG_COORD_OWNER_TYPE=user` with **no**
   `FSGG_COORD_OWNER` to drive the token's **own** `viewer` board with no login in config (the CLI labels
   it `@me`). Unset / `org` keeps the org default, byte-identical.
4. **The board governs this repository.** After the successful read, prove that the board has recorded at
   least one row for this repository, in any Status and whether its issue is open or closed. Capture the
   scoped read's stderr as well as its JSON — `ready` deliberately returns `[]` and exit `0` for a board
   it can read that names no such repository, and puts the useful “check the spelling, or this repo has
   no items” advisory on stderr. For example, run `scripts/fsgg-coord ready --repo <this-repo> --all
   --json >rows.json 2>ready.stderr`; only a successful command with a non-empty `rows.json` is proof of
   governance. If it is empty, stop cleanly without a board write, print `ready.stderr` verbatim, and say
   that the board does not yet govern this repository; point the operator to the coordination-kit/board
   retrofit path above. An entirely empty board cannot emit the scoped advisory (there is no known-repo
   set to compare), so say that explicitly rather than mistaking `[]` for a governed empty queue. An
   operator may explicitly acknowledge this ungoverned state and direct the run to continue; do not infer
   acknowledgement from a green exit code, an empty batch, or a later loop result.

   A leg that can fail: against a real reachable board whose history has no row for the checkout's repo,
   the command above exits `0`, writes `[]` to `rows.json`, and writes the scope advisory to
   `ready.stderr` (or has no advisory only when the whole board is empty). The fourth precondition must
   stop at this gate with that diagnostic, not enter the scheduling loop. Add a row for the repo and the
   same read becomes the positive control.

That is the whole of "or fail gracefully": the skill lands everywhere, and decides at runtime whether the
workspace is board-capable. A miss is a clean stop with a pointer, not an error.

Preconditions, once you know you *are* board-capable:

- The working tree is **clean** and `main` is up to date (`git fetch && git status`). The workers branch
  from `origin/main`, and a stale base manufactures fresh evidence for bugs already fixed (pnext-item §2).
- Board writes are authorised: `gh auth refresh -s project,read:project`, `issues: write`.
- You are **not** going to push to `main`. Every change is a PR; the merge guard blocks direct pushes,
  and an agent may *merge* only a green, reviewed PR — the same rule work-roadmap, drive-board and
  pnext-item hold.

## 1. The landmine: N subagents collapse onto ONE worker id (ADR-0064 §4.4)

Read this before anything else, because a work-board that skips it *looks* like it works and quietly
double-works items — and here, where every worker is in the **same tree**, that is worse than cross-repo.

`fsgg-coord whoami` resolves a worker id in this order (pnext-item §0, and it is the **engine's**, not
this doc's): `--worker <id>` → `$FSGG_WORKER` → the harness **session id** → *refuse*. On Claude Code
**every subagent of a session shares one `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID`** — so if the host spawns four
subagents and each runs a bare `whoami`, all four resolve to the **same** id. The claim lock is a
comment-order CAS over `fsgg:claim` markers, and it separates workers **only while their ids are
distinct** (ADR-0027, #419): an id two workers share is an id the lock cannot separate, and `release`,
`heartbeat`, `say` and `inbox` then act on one another's claims. The lock you are fanning out *behind* is
defeated at the root — and in one shared tree, two workers who both "hold" the same item edit the same
files.

**There is no worktree-name derivation to save you** — pnext-item §3 is explicit that the current engine
dropped it, so "each worker gets its own worktree" does **not** by itself give it its own id. The id must
be made distinct deliberately. This skill uses the mint-per-worker path:

- **Each worker mints its own id, inside its own isolated worktree.** The host spawns each subagent with
  the host's isolated-worktree option when supported (a fresh tree, so the per-checkout mint persists to *that* tree, not the shared
  one) and the worker's very first act is the one mint idiom:

  ```sh
  eval "$(scripts/fsgg-coord whoami --mint)"   # never invent one, never copy one (#419, #551)
  ```

**The worker's brief (§3) MUST make the mint its first step, and MUST stop if `whoami` warns.** `whoami`
warns precisely when the id came from the shared session — that warning is the tripwire for this bug, and
a worker that works through it holds no lock. The host cannot verify the workers' ids for them (it cannot
see inside their trees), so it verifies the **outcome** instead (§4).

## 2. The loop (what the HOST does)

The host is the agent that invoked `$work-board`. It **schedules; it never implements.** `<this-repo>` is
this one workspace's repo, resolved from the git remote — every `fsgg-coord` read below is scoped to it.
Repeat until §5 says the board is genuinely done:

1. **Reconcile first.** Run workspace-scoped `check-board` (dry run, then `--apply` for the
   mechanical fixes if you are driving unattended and trust the pass). This clears stale claims, flips
   `BLOCKER-CLEARED` items back to `Ready`, and — critically for blockers that appear *after* some work —
   **re-verifies every `Blocked by` edge**, so work a previous wave unblocked becomes visible. Read its
   complete four-part result: mechanical changes, queued/failed writes, judgement findings, and the
   fresh post-apply result. Its *asked-and-unanswered* list is work stuck on a **human**, not on you.
   An unreadable or unflushed result stops planning; it never becomes an empty board.
2. **Triage Backlog.** Follow [backlog-triage](backlog-triage.md) against a fresh workspace inventory.
   Classify every relevant row as promote to `Ready`, retain with an evidenced reason, set `Blocked`
   behind a verified issue, or awaiting human judgement. Do not infer missing paths, blocker meaning,
   epic discharge, scope, or priority. Apply supported writes and re-read them before sizing.
3. **Size the wave.** Ask the engine how many workers this repo can absorb *right now*:

   ```sh
   scripts/fsgg-coord batch --repo <this-repo> -n <cap> --json   # a maximal touch-set-disjoint set
   ```

   `batch` returns items that are `Ready`, unblocked, and **disjoint from each other and from everything
   in flight**. **Touch-set disjointness is load-bearing here** in a way it never is for drive-board: all
   workers share one working tree, so items must be file-disjoint or a wave stomps itself — which is
   exactly what `take` + `intra-repo-parallel-work` enforce. The
   **size** of that set is how many parallel `take`-workers to spawn this instant; cap it against the
   shared rate budget (§6). Do **not** pass the item numbers to the workers — `batch` is the host's
   *sizing* read and `take` is the worker's *claiming* read, and keeping them separate is what preserves
   `take`'s lost-race guarantee (drive-board §2).
4. **Spawn fresh implementers within the cap** (using the host's available worker/subagent mechanism; request an isolated worktree when supported), each running
   the worker brief (§3). One subagent, one `take`-loop-of-one: it takes an item, works it to done-stamp,
   and returns. Reserve critic capacity instead of filling the cap with implementers. At each review
   handoff, spawn a fresh critic, keep the implementer alive for up to three numbered repair/review
   rounds, and require the same critic to confirm each exact head. An exhausted third round parks for
   human action instead of merging. Concurrency is bounded — one repo, one shared account (§6).
5. **Collect each worker as it returns, and verify — do not trust (§4).** A worker reports the item it
   took, the PR it merged, and anything it filed or found. The subagent is now dead; its context is gone,
   which is deliberate.
6. **Re-plan.** The board has moved — new `Blocked by` edges a worker discovered, items now `Done`,
   follow-ups filed as new `Backlog` rows. Discard the prior inventory and go back to step 1.
   Reconciliation and Backlog triage are both mandatory before another spawn: that is how an edge or
   follow-up that appears only after work enters the very next disjoint wave.

Never let the host "just finish one quickly" itself — the whole value is that every item goes through a
worker that runs the full pnext-item loop, and a host that starts editing has no worktree, no claim, and
no touch-set reservation, in the one tree every worker shares.

## 3. The worker: a pnext-item envelope with explicit delivery-route receipt

The invariant per-item harness is **`pnext-item`** (already materialized): mint a
distinct worker id, `take` (gate on exit code 0), read the item's comments, worktree from `origin/main`,
implement within the declared `Paths:`, open a PR, obtain independent critique, merge on green,
`done --flip`. Inside that one
claim/merge/done-stamp envelope, the worker consumes a **current, explicit agent-authored delivery-route
receipt**. The fixed checklist records multi-repo, public-contract, migration/release/security/recovery,
coordinated-provider, and independent-evidence facts, but it never infers the route. A `lightweight`
receipt permits focused delivery; an `sdd-required` receipt binds the governing `fsgg-sdd` work, canonical
spec home, and current SDD receipts. Both remain inside one claim/merge/done-stamp envelope.

### The per-worker subagent brief

The host hands each subagent essentially this, with `<REPO>` (this workspace's repo) substituted:

> You are one worker in a fan-out **inside one shared working tree**. **Claim ONE schedulable item in
> `<REPO>`, take it to merged and done-stamped, report, and exit.** You run in your own isolated worktree;
> you may not push to `main` (every change is a PR; a green, reviewed PR may be merged).
>
> 1. **Become someone first.** Your very first command, before anything else:
>    `eval "$(scripts/fsgg-coord whoami --mint)"`. If `whoami` warns that your id came from the session,
>    **stop and report it** — you hold no lock, and working anyway puts two workers on one item in the one
>    tree we all share. Do not invent or copy an id.
> 2. **Run `pnext-item` for `<REPO>`**: `take` (gate on the
>    exit code — 0 is the *only* code that means you hold an item, #585), read the item's **comments**
>    before you start (a prior worker's "do not do this" is the highest-signal thing on the board),
>    `git fetch` then worktree from `origin/main` by name, implement **inside your declared `Paths:`** (in
>    a shared tree, a path you did not declare is one another worker may be editing). Pause before
>    opening the PR for steps 3–4, then resume pnext-item: push and open the candidate, pause for the host's
>    independent critic, implement up to three numbered repairs, merge only after the same critic
>    confirms the current head, and `done --flip` to earn the stamp. If round three still fails, never
>    start round four: close that PR without merging and automatically enter one fresh repair phase.
>    Park for human action and release the claim only if the repair phase exhausts or its route is unavailable.
> 3. **Consume the route receipt.** Do not infer from effort, size, labels, or prose. A current
>    `lightweight` receipt permits direct implementation; an `sdd-required` receipt requires its named
>    `fsgg-sdd` work/spec/readiness bindings before implementation — still inside this one envelope.
> 4. **Checkpoint and finalize development feedback before opening the PR.** Use one stable cycle id
>    based on the item number and slug. Checkpoint only material observations at: onboarding/first
>    build; lifecycle authoring when used; first implementation/test/evidence loop; and
>    verify/ship/PR orchestration. Capture misleading guidance, avoidable retries, workarounds,
>    capability gaps, and unexpectedly effective composition when they occur. Finalize one schema-v2
>    report, search prior reports and open/closed issues for recurrence, run the bundled validator,
>    and include the checkpoint JSONL plus report in this item's PR.
> 5. **A blocker you discover is the point, not a failure.** If the item cannot proceed until other work
>    lands, file that work at its **root cause** (pnext-item §4), set `Blocked by` on this item to the
>    blocker, and `release --status Blocked` so the board tells the truth. Report the blocker you filed —
>    the host schedules around it next wave.
> 6. **Implementation findings you make, you FIX in the same PR when that keeps it reviewable**, or file
>    at the root cause — pnext-item §4 is the authority. Once independent review begins, the critic
>    exclusively owns review-discovered root-cause search, dedupe, and direct filing, and may file only
>    material unresolved work. Do **not** recurse into a second item yourself: you are one worker
>    in a wave, and the host owns what comes next. Report what you filed; the host pops it.
> 7. **If `take` exits 5 (nothing schedulable) or 75 (rate budget exhausted)**, do not spin. Report the
>    exit code and stop — 5 means the repo is dry for now, 75 means the shared budget is gone and the host
>    must back the whole fleet off (§6).
> 8. **Report back**: the item number, the merged PR, the done-stamp, feedback report path, any
>    blocker/finding you filed (with
>    issue numbers), and the `take` exit code if you got no item. Then exit.
>
> If the item cannot land from here and it is not a clean blocker to file — it needs a human decision, or
> another repo owns the actual fix — do **not** fake a merge. Report it and stop; the host surfaces it.

## 4. Verify against ground truth — never the subagent's word

This is drive-board §5 and work-roadmap step 5, and it is the failure mode most worth catching: **a
subagent that reports "merged" on a PR that did not merge.** The host cannot see inside a dead subagent's
context, so it checks the world the subagent claims to have changed. For each returned worker:

```sh
scripts/fsgg-coord ready --repo <this-repo> --all --json   # the always-fresh TRUTH read of the column
```

- The item it claimed to finish is **`Done`** on the board and its issue is **closed** — or the worker
  reported a blocker, in which case it is **`Blocked`** with a `Blocked by` edge. If it says "merged" and
  the item is still `In progress` or `Ready`, **treat it as a failed item, not a passed one** — and check
  for a **stale claim with a green open PR**, the real success path of a worker whose harness died between
  green and merge: `adopt` it rather than binning it (#697, intra-repo §3).
- No **orphaned claim** is left holding the item — and holding, in one shared tree, a touch-set the next
  wave needs. If the worker died mid-flight, `reap` a lapsed lease — **unless** its `item/<n>-*` PR is
  open, which is proof the work is alive and outranks the timer (#581).
- The **rate budget** did not silently strand a write. If any worker returned 75, run
  `scripts/fsgg-coord flush --dry-run` before the next wave — a queued board write that nothing replays
  reads later as drift you will "find" and duplicate.
- The PR carries `<!-- fsgg:review-decision/v2 -->` for the exact reviewed/confirmed head, the
  critic is not the implementer, every material finding has a terminal disposition, and every filed
  issue is directly verified. No nonmaterial observation created an issue, board row, blocker edge, or
  follow-up entry.

Do not take a merge you can check on the worker's say-so. Read `ready`, not the report.

## 5. Termination — via check-board, not via an empty `take`

The loop ends when the board is **genuinely** done, and the trap is that a **drifted board looks done
when it is not** — the entire reason `check-board` exists. So do not stop because
a `take` returned 5, or because one `batch` came back empty. Stop only when a **fresh** reconcile and
[backlog-triage](backlog-triage.md) pass show all of:

- **No schedulable item** — `batch --repo <this-repo>` empty, and `next` explains *why* each remaining
  candidate is skipped (blocked or no touch-set) rather than startable.
- **No actionable or untriaged Backlog remains.** Every current row was classified: actionable rows
  were promoted before `batch`; retained rows have a concrete evidenced reason; human judgement rows
  are surfaced in the completion report without spinning.
- **No live claims in flight** — `who --repo <this-repo>` shows nothing held (or only stale ones you have
  reaped/adopted).
- **No `EPIC-ROLLUP-READY` epics and no cleared-but-still-`Blocked` items** left in check-board's
  findings. An item `Blocked` behind an issue that shipped is work advertised as unstartable; a
  rollup-ready epic is a `yes`/`no` a human owes. These are **not** an empty board — they are the board
  lying, and check-board is what distinguishes them.

A remaining candidate blocked on a **human** (`awaiting-human`, or check-board's *asked-and-unanswered*
list) is **not** yours to unblock and **not** a reason to keep spinning. Surface it and stop — driving it
yourself would make the machine answer the decision the item exists to escalate.

## 6. Concurrency and the one budget the whole fleet shares

One repo, one account, one shared rate budget: GraphQL (5,000 pt/hr, the board reads) and **REST (5,000
req/hr, where the claim lock lives** — ADR-0034 §3, #895). REST is the scarcer one under fan-out — metered
per request, un-batchable — and **five workers looping `take` drained GraphQL in ~15 minutes** once
(#418). So concurrency is a cap, and the cap is a rate-limit decision. Three rules keep the fan-out from
taking the board down (identical discipline to drive-board §3):

- **Cap in-flight workers conservatively** (`$work-board --workers N`, default low). A board with 40
  schedulable items does not mean 40 workers; it means the cap's worth, then the next wave.
- **Let the workers share the 90s scan cache.** The host's own planning reads (`check-board`, `batch`)
  scan **fresh** — a reconciler on a stale board invents drift — but the *workers'* `take`/`next` reads
  must **not** add `--fresh`, or N workers cost N board reads instead of one.
- **Treat a worker's `EX_RATE` (exit 75) as a fleet-wide stop, not that worker's problem.** One worker
  hitting the REST cap means the *account* hit it, so every other worker is about to. **Stop spawning, let
  the in-flight ones drain, back off until the reset it names**, then `scripts/fsgg-coord flush --dry-run`
  — a board write made on an exhausted budget is *queued and nothing replays it* (pnext-item §1). Do not
  loop into the limit; REST carries the lock, and a lock you cannot verify is not one.

`scripts/fsgg-coord budget` shows GraphQL only — REST's remaining requests are not queryable (pnext-item
§5), which is *why* the cap is conservative and the 75-back-off is reactive, not predictive.

## 7. The completion report

When §5 says done, the host — **itself, not a subagent** — writes a report and lands it, the same close-out
[work-roadmap](../../work-roadmap/SKILL.md) and `drive-board` use. Write
`docs/reports/<YYYY-MM-DD>-workboard.md`, timestamped for today: what shipped this run (items, merged PRs,
done-stamps), the blockers workers discovered and where they were filed, the follow-ups they queued, every
rate-limit back-off, and the outstanding human-blocked items check-board named. Follow the house report
style already in `docs/reports/`. Aggregate the item feedback reports by recurring root cause and owner,
avoidable cost, positive patterns worth promoting, and development-surface coverage gaps; do not
concatenate them. **Land it as its own reviewed PR** — feature branch, open, review, merge
on green — the last thing to merge. Then report to the operator: board burned down, report PR number, and
the list of items still parked on a human.

## Failure handling

- **A worker that reports a merge that did not happen** is caught by §4 (verify against `ready`, not the
  report). Failed item, not passed — re-plan will re-offer it, or `adopt` its green orphan PR.
- **Two workers on one item** means §1 was skipped — the ids collapsed onto the session, and in one shared
  tree they are now editing the same files. Stop the fan-out, `who`/`reap` the tangle, and fix the brief so
  the mint is the first step. This is the bug the whole skill is arranged to prevent; if you see it, the
  arrangement failed, not the protocol.
- **A wave that stomps its own tree** means the disjointness §2 relies on was not respected — a worker
  edited outside its declared `Paths:`. That is why the worker brief pins the item *inside* its declaration
  and the host sizes waves off `batch` (disjoint by construction) rather than picking items by hand.
- **`EX_RATE` (75) from any worker** is a fleet stop (§6): drain, back off to the named reset, `flush`,
  resume. Never loop into the limit.
- **The workspace is not board-capable** is not a failure — it is the graceful-fail path (§4.1 above under
  *Where this runs*). Print the one line naming `work-roadmap`/`new-sdd-workspace --board` and stop; do not
  degrade into a plain edit loop.
- **Never bypass the merge guard.** No direct push to `main`, no local `git merge` into `main`. Every
  change is a PR; the only allowance is that a worker may *merge* a green, reviewed one.
